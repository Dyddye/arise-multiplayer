The mod consists of two components:

1. The native code (written in C++)
2. The blueprints that handle some stuff in UE4

## Compiling the code

1. Open `Mod/UnrealEngineModLoader/UnrealEngineModLoader.sln` with Visual Studio 2019.
2. Change configuration to either `Development` or `Release` and build the code.

## Building the blueprints

1. Install UE4.20
2. Open the project
3. Build
